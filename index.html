        <div id="tribute-info">
            <p>Ada Lovelace was born Augusta Ada Byon in London on 
                December 10, 1815. She was the daughter of Annabella 
                Byron and Lord Byron, the famous poet. Only a month 
                after Ada was born, her mother left Lord Byron due to 
                his alcholism and infidelity. Shortly after their
                seperation, Lord Byron would leave England forever.
                Ada never knew him personally.</p>
            
            <p>From an early age, Ada showed a talent 
                for numbers and language. And Lady Byron, 
                determined to prevent her daughter from 
                inheriting her father's volatile temperament,
                promoted Ada's interest in mathematics, science 
                and logic.</p>
            
            <p>Although a sickly child, Ada pursued her education
                tirelessly. Throughout her lifetime she woulc receive 
                instruction from Augustus De Morgan, the first professor 
                of mathematics at the University of London; William 
                Frend, a social reformer; and eventually Charles Babbage, 
                a mathematician and inventor who would later be 
                referred to as the father of the computer. She also,
                through her educational exploits, would meet famed
                scientists such as Michael Faraday, Andrew Crosse
                and Charles Wheatstone.</p>
            
            <p>In 1835, at the age of 19, Ada was married to aristocrat
                William King. When he was made Earl of Lovelace 
                in 1838 she officially became Lady Ada King, 
                Countess of Lovelace. This is why she is generally 
                called Ada Lovelace. Her and King had three children. </p>

            <p>Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage by their mutual friend and 
                her tutor Mary Somerville in 1833. She was particularly
                interested in Babbage's work on building an Analytical 
                Engine, whose design had all the essential elements 
                of a modern-day computer. Lovelace actually translated
                an article, which described the Analytical Engine,
                by an Italian mathematician named Luigi Menabrea, for 
                publication in England. </p>
                
            <p>Babbage eventually asked Ada to expand the article,
                “as she understood the machine so well”. Her final article 
                ended up being three times longer than the original and included
                several early ‘computer programs’ as well as detailed and astute
                observations on the potential uses of the machine, such
                as the creation of music. “The Analytical Engine,” she said, 
                “weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard-loom 
                weaves flowers and leaves.”</p>
            
            <p>Babbage would go on to only build a small part of the Analytical
                Engine and it would never be fully finished until Ada’s 
                notes became one of the critical documents to inspire 
                Alan Turing’s work on the first modern computers 
                in the 1940s. In honor of Ada Lovelace's work, the early programming
                language Ada was named after her. And she is still hailed
                today as a powerful symbol for modern women in technology.

            <p>Ada Lovelace died of uterine cancer on November 
                27, 1852, at the age of thirty-six, only a 
                few short years after the publication of “Sketch of 
                the Analytical Engine, with Notes from the Translator”.</p>
